# Documentation for Ursa

This repository is for documentation, specifications, and anything else for 
[ursa](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa).

Documents are broken down into the following folders:

- [docs](docs/README.md) is used for documenting the APIs and how to use the ursa library. Ursa uses [mdBook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/) for now. 
- [specs](specs/README.md) is used for papers and specifications that are written in Latex.
